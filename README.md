  In a business context, the role of a computer scientist is to deploy and maintain technological solutions that enhance operational efficiency and support strategic goals. However, on a more personal level, I believe the role of a computer scientist extends beyond business; it should focus on improving quality of life by learning from and iterating upon past experiences. Often, we may not fully understand a system's intricacies but can recognize the desired outcome. This gap between knowledge and outcome is where I see the computer scientist’s role truly begin.

  Our project, though based on a fictitious business, offered valuable insights, especially with the modular design of the CRUD module. While specific tools, like MongoDB, may evolve over time, the foundational ability to implement a CRUD module is likely to remain relevant. By creating a dashboard that visualizes data and enables users to build tailored solutions, our project could help others perform their roles more effectively. My approach to this project didn’t differ dramatically from other courses, though the end result feels more practical and beneficial for my future work. Unlike some courses, which might involve creating non-functional projects, this course has provided me with a tool I could realistically use in real-world scenarios.
